3) Start the Corba Buffer service in "ServidorComponenteCORBA\src\server\BufferServer.java" (Run as Java Application)

4) If you want to act like manager to read and write news, run "Productor-Consumidor\src\client\Servlet.java" on Tomcat. There you can access the servlet to add news to the corba server, later you can read them from the Angular Client.
